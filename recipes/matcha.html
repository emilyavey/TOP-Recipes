    <h2>How to Make Matcha Latte</h2>
    <p>This is how to make an energizing drink you can make at home! While matcha 
        may not be caffeinated as a normal coffee, this drink can be the gentle
        encouraging push to get something done. 
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons of matcha powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of hot water</li>
        <li>Milk (or any milk alternative)</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Ice (optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a measuring cup or bowl, whisk the matcha powder and hot water together
            until frothy. While it's better to use the bamboo matcha whisk, a standard 
            whisk will get the job done. 
        </li>
        <li>If you want to add any sugar, this is when to do it as the warm mixture will
            help the sugar dissolve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the mixture into a cup and add ice cubes (if you want a colder drink) and milk until satisfied. Stir.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it! I hope you enjoy your fresh matcha latte :)</p>
