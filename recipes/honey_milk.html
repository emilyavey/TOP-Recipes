        <h2>honey milk</h2>
        <p>This is a very quick and soothing drink you can make at home! The sweet, rich
            taste of honey combined with the warm, gentle milk creates a humble drink that 
            anyone can find comfort in. Bonus points: you can use any milk alternative and
            it's just as tasty without the stomach discomfort!
        </p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <p>Note: The recipe requires very little and emphasizes the tastes of the honey and milk,
            so it's advised to use yummy versions of both core ingredients. If you've been
            hoarding some delicious honey, now's the time to use it!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>You can heat up the milk via stovetop until just before boiling (you don't want to burn the milk!) or by putting a cup (any general cup, not the 
                measurement) and heating it up in the microwave. I tend to leave my cup in the microwave for about 1 minute and 30 seconds. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the milk is a little too hot to drink, stir in your desired amount of honey. When the milk is hot enough, the honey will
                have an easier time dissolving. Keep adding honey until you like the taste of the drink.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>That is it! I hope you enjoy your fresh hot honey milk :)</p>
