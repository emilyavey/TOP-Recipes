    <h2>How to Make Wintermelon Milk Drink</h2>
    <p>This is how to make a sweet and savory drink that uses fresh wintermelon! While this
        is a drink recipe, the recipe for the wintermelon syrup will also be provided.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg (~3.5 lb) wintermelon</li>
        <li>250 g (~ 9 oz) brown sugar</li>
        <li>50 g (~1.8oz) white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Note: For the signature caramelly taste of wintermelon syrup, I recommend replacing 
        brown sugar with slab brown sugar and replacing white sugar with rock sugar. 
    </p>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Milk Drink</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wintermelon syrup</li>
        <li>Milk (or any milk alternative)</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Ice (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For Winermelon Syrup</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the wintermelon. Scoop out the seeds inside and then cut the
            wintermelon meat into small pieces.
        </li>
        <li>In a large pot on low heat, add the cubed wintermelon pieces and both sugars.
            Let that sit for about an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Regularly check the pot and give the mixture a stir. When the wintermelon pieces
            are soft and brown and the syrup is thick, turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the contents of the pot and press as much liquid as you can. The strained
            liquid is the wintermelon syrup. The remaining solid contents can be blended into a 
            puree to be enjoyed similarly as the syrup or as a condiment over bread or yogurt. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Milk Drink</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 1 part wintermelon syrup with 3 parts milk into a cup. Add sugar or ice to your liking.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's it! I hope you enjoy your fresh wintermelon milk drink :)</p>
