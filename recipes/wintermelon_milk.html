    <h2>How to Make Wintermelon Milk Drink</h2>
    <p>This is how to make a sweet and savory drink that uses fresh wintermelon! While this
        is a drink recipe, the recipe for the wintermelon syrup will also be provided.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg (~3.5 lb) wintermelon</li>
        <li>250 g (~ 9 oz) brown sugar</li>
        <li>50 g (~1.8oz) white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Note: For the signature caramelly taste of wintermelon syrup, I recommend replacing 
        brown sugar with slab brown sugar and replacing white sugar with rock sugar. 
    </p>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Milk Drink</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Winermelon syrup</li>
        <li>Milk (or any milk alternative)</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Ice (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For Winermelon Syrup</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the wintermelon. Scoop out the seeds inside and then cut the
            wintermelon meat into small pieces. You can keep the seeds to add it later
            if you'd like to add a hint of bitterness to your drink.
        </li>
        <li>In a large pot on low heat, add the cubed wintermelon pieces and both sugars.
            Let that sit for about an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Regularly check the pot and give the mixture a stir. When the wintermelon pieces
            are soft and brown and the syrup is thick, turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the contents of the pot and press as much liquid as you can. The strained
            is the wintermelon syrup. The remaining solid contents can be blended into a 
            puree to be enjoyed similarly as the syrup or as a condiment over bread or yogurt. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For Wintermelon Milk Drink</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 1 part wintermelon syrup with 3 parts milk. Add sugar or ice to your liking.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it! I hope you enjoy your fresh wintermelon milk drink :)</p>
